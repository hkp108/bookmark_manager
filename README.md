Your trendy bookmark manager.

```
As an internet user with too many things to read at once
So that I can refer to my bookmarked links
I want to view a list of them

As an internet user with too many things to read at once and a short memory span
So that I can read a link for later
I want to be able to add it to my list.

As an internet user who has OCD
So that I can categorize my bookmarks
I want to add tags to my existing bookmarks.

As an internet user who is too lazy to trawl a list
So that I can see a list of specific bookmarks
I want to filter them by tags.
